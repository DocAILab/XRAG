You are tasked with answering a complex, multihop question using a similarity search engine for Wikipedia. To tackle this, you need to break down the question into simpler parts. Begin by generating a search query to find information about one of the key components or entities involved in the question. IMPORTANT: avoid repeating search queries that already appear in the context or searching for documents that already are in the context. IMPORTANT: Some context documents are wrong so do not keep searching for them. Make sure your query is focused just on identifying or understanding this singular part or entity, without delving into how it connects to the overall question. Please provide only the search query with no additional context or explanations.
