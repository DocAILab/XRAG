Key methodologies include\nStep-back Prompting ( SBPT [41]): Broaden’s queries to enrich contextual grounding for answers,\nenhancing the contextual foundation for answer generation.

Both HyDE andCoVe mandate pre-\nretrieval instructions, which involve generating hypothetical documents and responses consultation\nusing query first, affirming their role as core components of the pre-retrieval process.\n♠Retriever For advanced retrieval strategies, we integrate the LlamaIndex to facilitate standard\nadvanced methods.

    "source_text": "We integrate\nthe Jury [ 5], a comprehensive package for the evaluation of NLG systems, with RAG community\nevaluation tools such as UpTrain3and DeepEval4. Our metrics are pivotal in determining the\neffectiveness of both the retrieval and generation components. They are categorized into three groups:\nConventional Retrieval Evaluation and Conventional Generation Evaluation, along with an additional\ncategory for Cognitive LLM Evaluation.\nConventional Retrieval Evaluation (ConR) . It supports six primary metrics: F1, Exact Match (EM),\nMean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Mean Average Precision (MAP), along with Hit@1 and Hit@5.\nAdditionally, it includes the DCG family of metrics, which assesses the effectiveness of ranking\nmodels by evaluating the quality of ordered results ( retrieval-context.ids ). This family comprises\nDiscounted Cumulative Gain (DCG), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Ideal\nDiscounted Cumulative Gain (IDCG). IDCG is the maximum DCG that can be obtained if the results\nare ideally ranked – arranged in descending order of their relevance ( golden-context.ids ).\nConventional Generation Evaluation (ConG) . These generative-token matching metrics can be clas-\nsified into three broad categories. N-gram similarity metrics: ChrF [ 31], ChrF++ [ 32], METEOR [ 2],\nROUGE F1 [ 34] (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) focus on overlap in n-grams between genera-\ntion ( actual-response ) and reference ( expected-answer ). Divergence-based metrics: MAUVE [ 30],\nPerplexity [ 18] measure content quality, diversity, and model learning by comparing the distribution\nbetween the generation and reference. Error-based accuracy metrics: Word Error Rate (WER) [ 29],\nCharacter Error Rate (CER) [ 29] and Exact Match (EM), assess the accuracy of actual-response by\ncalculating the differences or errors when compared with the expected-answer .\nCognitive LLM Evaluation (CogL) . Based on their evaluation focus, they can be classified into\nthree main categories: Retrieval, Generation, and Combined Retrieval & Generation. Cognitive LLM\nEvaluation metrics, derived from UpTrain and DeepEval, are classified based on the parameters\nused by our framework. Metrics involving response-related parameters, such as actual-response\n3https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain\n4https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval\n5\norexpected-answer , are Generation Metrics. Conversely, metrics that lack response parameters\ninclude retrieval-related parameters, such as retrieval-context orretrieval-context.ids , are\ndesignated as Retrieval Metrics. The rest are Combined Metrics. Retrieval Metrics assess context qual-\nity and consist of Context Relevance (Up-CRel) and Context Conciseness (Up-CCns), which comes\nfrom UpTrain. Response Metrics include Response Relevance (Dp-ARel), Response Completeness\n(Up-RCmp) from DeepEval, Response Conciseness (Up-RCnc), Response Relevance (Up-RRel), and\nResponse Validity (Up-RVal) and Response Matching (Up-RMch) from Uptrain. Combined Metrics\nevaluate the impact of retrieval on final responses and include Context Precision (Dp-CPre), Context\nRecall (Dp-CRec), Context Relevance (Dp-CRel), Response Consistency (Up-RCns), Context Utiliza-\ntion (Up-CUti), and Factual Accuracy (Up-FAcc), Faithfulness (Dp-Faith), Hallucination (Dp-Hall).\nMetrics prefixed with ‘Up’ originate from UpTrain, while those prefixed with ‘Dp’ are from DeepEval.\nDetailed usage patterns of CogL evaluation are illustrated in Appendix A.4. Moreover, we utilize\nGPT-4 Turbo as the LLM agent for cognitive evaluation.\nThe XRAG evaluator presents several significant advantages:\n•Evaluating with Multiple RAG Metrics in One Go : The XRAG evaluator allows users to assess\nvarious RAG-specific metrics simultaneously. This capability streamlines the evaluation process,\nenabling comprehensive performance analysis without sequential evaluations.\n•Standardizes the Structure of Evaluation Metrics : A unified data format simplifies comparing\nacross different RAG components on both retrieval and generation.\n•Character and Semantic ×Retrieval and Generation : It encompasses 4-fold cross-dimensional\nanalysis, including character-level matching tests and semantic-level understanding tests for both\nretrieval and generation."

    "source_text": "However, RAG systems may struggle to fully grasp\nthe complexity and diverse implicit information needs of such tasks, affecting the efficiency of the\nretrieval module and leading to the failure to identify all relevant cross-document segments. Coupled\nwith the limitations in the reasoning capabilities of LLMs when faced with complex document inputs,\nthis can ultimately impact the accuracy of the reasoning outcomes.\nIn-depth details of this investigation, including systematic analysis and improvement strategies, are\npresented in Appendix A.2.\n4 Experimental Results and Discussion\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nBoth the retriever and Q&A LLMs are essential modules of the RAG system. To focus on evaluating\nthe Q&A capabilities of different LLMs, we fixed the retriever to the BGE-LARGE model version,\nas the retriever serves as the primary entry point influencing RAG performance. For document\npreprocessing, we utilized SentenceSplitter to divide documents into chunks and construct a vector\nindex. SentenceSplitter was configured with a chunk size of 1024 tokens, representing the maximum\nsequence length and a chunk overlap of 20 tokens, denoting the overlap between consecutive chunks.\nWe adhered to LlamaIndex configurations for other RAG components, including the refine module\nfor response synthesis. To ensure compatibility and efficiency, XRAG integrates Huggingface\nTransformers. All Q&A LLMs were set with Temperature = 0to ensure experimental consistency.\nFor each query, five chunks were retrieved as contextual data. Consequently, the evaluation metrics\nmeasure retrieval accuracy based on five retrieval nodes, fully encompassing the assumptions of\nmost datasets that typically consider only one or two golden contextual nodes. The metrics include\nHIT, DCG, NDCG, and IDCG, with a search depth K= 5.

As an effective\nmeans commonly employed in the domain of LLMs to address a wide range of problems, prompt\nengineering represents the simplest solution to the challenge of negative refusal.\n•Two-step Reasoning : The two-step reasoning process leverages the capabilities of LLMs first\nto assess their ability to answer a given query. Only when the model determines it has adequate\ninformation to respond does it proceed to the second step to provide a specific answer, thus arriving\nat the final inference. Conversely, if the initial assessment concludes that there is insufficient\ninformation to answer, the second step of reasoning is declined, thereby preventing the generation\nof hallucinatory responses.\nExperimental Settings . To quantify the system’s capacity for negative refusal, we first constructed a\ndataset comprising 20 randomly sampled questions, each paired with unrelated context to simulate\nscenarios where the model cannot access necessary information."
